# hott3_adj_files
This Repository contains files formalizing and extending concepts from the Homotopy Type Theory Book.
This repository contains files created by Daniel Carranza, Jonathan Chang, and Ryan Sandford
during their summer 2019 research term. These files are intended to be used with the gebner/hott3 repository.

adj.lean contains definitions and theorems regarding half adjoint equivalences which formalize
